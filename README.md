# TIC-TAC-TOE
This is a simple tic-tac-toe game with the exception of playing against an algorithm or against a friend. <br>
At the very start, you have to select your marker `X` or `O`. Note: `X` goes first. <br>
You can simply play by clicking on an empty spot when it's your turn. <br>
If you've clicked on 3 consecutive spots for any horizontal, vertical or diagonal spots, you win!
